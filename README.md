# Universal Universe Law Checker
*if the universe is ok, but programm tells you not, then either you're in matrix or it's JS issue =D*

[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

## Installation
UULC was written in VS Community 2019, so to open project:
1. Download source code
2. Unpack everything into any folder
3. Open `UULC.sln` in VS

## To compile:
1. Open Terminal in VS (View > Terminal)
2. Change it from PowerShell to Command Prompt (Developer PowerShell > Developer Command Prompt)
3. Install pkg if you don't have it (`npm install pkg`)
4. `pkg app.js`
5. Built `.exe` file will be in source folder. There's also will be files for Linux and Mac OS, but I have no idea how to open them.
