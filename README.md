# Universal Universe Law Checker
*if the universe is ok, but programm tells you not, then either you're in matrix or it's JS issue =D*

## Installation
UULC was written in VS Community 2019, so to open project:
1. Download source code
2. Unpack everything into any folder
3. Open `UULC.sln` in VS

## To compile:
1. Open Terminal in VS (View > Terminal)
2. Change it from PowerShell to Command Prompt (Developer PowerShell > Developer Command Prompt)
3. Install pkg if you don't have it (`npm install pkg`)
4. `pkg app.js`
5. Built `.exe` file will be in source folder. There's also will be files for Linux and Mac OS, but I have no idea how to open them.
